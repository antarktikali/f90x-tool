# Intro
This tool is intended to communicate with the Nikon F90x/N90s camera over the
serial interface. I started this project in order to help me with learning
rust.

The tool currently supports the following functions:
- Triggering autofocus
- Triggering shutter release
- Reading from memory
- Writing to memory

There is a separate repository for the documentation of the serial interface:
